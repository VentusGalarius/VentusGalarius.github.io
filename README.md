The project is currently in the development stage.
the purpose of this project:
1) make a copy of the site fragment.com
2) make a copy of the oauth API, in order to create a subdomain, on which you can log in to sites through bots.
3) make a copy of the API fragment, using reverse engineering to get all working endpoints.
4) Fix scripts and resources
5) Improve transaction system: payment by cryptocurrency + API stripe (test card: 4242424242424242), + API fragment.
6) authorization on the test backend of telegram: Telegram Beta client (org.telegram.messenger.beta), +test online web version: https://web.telegram.org/ + /a/ or without /a/, + /?test=1 or /?test=backend
7) If you can register on the test server, then to contact me in the search enter the username: @blurname (test server, no production!)
8) implement the user interface: premium, stars, gifts, and so on...
9) implement authorization via a-toauth.stel.com, +possibility to connect a wallet

2) implement auction alerts, who placed a bid, where and when
3) notify that the price for a user or anonymous number has changed.
4) the ability to contact the site through the bot, and start auctions, as well as place bids.
